## 👋 Welcome to DataShield Labs

**DataShield Labs** is an open-source initiative focused on building practical tools, frameworks, and research to enhance **data privacy**, **security**, and **AI safety** in modern software systems.

We believe that as AI systems and cloud-native applications continue to scale, safeguarding user data and enforcing robust security controls becomes a critical responsibility for every engineer. Our mission is to create accessible, developer-friendly solutions that help organizations of all sizes adopt stronger privacy and security practices.

### 🔐 What We Work On
- **AI Privacy & Safety**
  - Preventing PII leakage in LLMs  
  - Redaction pipelines for model inputs/outputs  
  - Privacy-preserving middleware for generative AI workflows  

- **Application Security**
  - Open-source security scanners  
  - Misconfiguration detection for cloud & databases  
  - Threat modeling templates and tooling  

- **Compliance & Risk Mitigation**
  - Developer-first tools aligned with GDPR, CCPA, SOC2  
  - Data minimization utilities  
  - Consent and data-lifecycle tracking modules  

### 🎯 Our Vision
To empower developers and organizations with **simple, transparent, and open** tools that reduce risk and strengthen trust. Data privacy should not be a barrier — it should be built-in.

### 🧪 Current Projects
- `ai-privacy-guard`: Detect and redact sensitive information in LLM prompts and responses  
- `cloud-sec-auditor`: Lightweight scanner for identifying security risks in cloud database configurations  
- More tools and research coming soon…

### 🤝 We Welcome Contributions
Security and privacy are community efforts. If you're passionate about AI safety, cloud security, or data protection, feel free to open issues, submit PRs, or share ideas for new modules.

Join us in building a safer digital ecosystem — one line of code at a time.
